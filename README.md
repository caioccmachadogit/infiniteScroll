Motivation
----------

For a long time I couldn't find the right implementation of the infinite scroll AKA endless scroll for Android. A few solutions I've found weren't production ready, weren't working correctly or had too many features. I wanted to have small, easy and flexible solution to implement infinite scroll for Android, which works with `RecyclerView` from the newest Android API. That's why this project was created. If you want to read more, check out <a href="http://blog.wittchen.biz.pl/infinite-scroll-for-recyclerview-in-android/">an article about this project on my blog</a>.

Examples
--------

Sample app can be found in `app` directory.

Below, you can see an animation presenting, how sample application works.

Moreover, you can see examplary usage of this library in [SearchTwitter](https://github.com/pwittchen/SearchTwitter) app.

![Demo](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/pwittchen/InfiniteScroll/master/demo.gif)

Usage
-----

Create necessary fields in your `Activity`:

```java
public RecyclerView recyclerView;
private LinearLayoutManager layoutManager;
```

Create new `InfiniteScrollListener`:

```java
private InfiniteScrollListener createInfiniteScrollListener() {
  return new InfiniteScrollListener(maxItemsPerRequest, layoutManager) {
    @Override public void onScrolledToEnd(final int firstVisibleItemPosition) {
      // load your items here
      // logic of loading items will be different depending on your specific use case
      
      // when new items are loaded, combine old and new items, pass them to your adapter
      // and call refreshView(...) method from InfiniteScrollListener class to refresh RecyclerView
      refreshView(recyclerView, new MyAdapter(items), firstVisibleItemPosition);
    }
  }
}
```

Initialize `RecyclerView` and `LinearLayoutManager` in your `Activity`:

```java
@Override protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
  recyclerView = (RecyclerView) findViewById(R.id.recycler_view);

  layoutManager = new LinearLayoutManager(this);
  recyclerView.setHasFixedSize(true);
  recyclerView.setLayoutManager(layoutManager);
  
  // set your custom adapter
  recyclerView.setAdapter(new MyAdapter(items));
  
  // add InfiniteScrollListener as OnScrollListener
  recyclerView.addOnScrollListener(createInfiniteScrollListener());
}
```

If you want to display loading progress, you should add additional view for it, show it while loading starts and hide it when loading is finished. Check exemplary app in this repository to see concrete solution.

That's it!

Download
--------
